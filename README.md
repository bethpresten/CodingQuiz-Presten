# CodingQuiz-Presten

Description

The purpose was to have a timed quiz assessments that has the following capabilities:

1.  Several multiple choice questions.
2.  The ability to recognize if the button clicked was the correct answer.
3.  A penalty of 15 seconds for an incorrect answer.
4.  Submitting a final score and the ability to utilize local storage.

Challenges

This was the most challenging homework assignment by far. I triaged the importance of the problems as following:

1. Welcome Screen with the start quiz button.
2. Populating the questions and answers.
3. Utilizing a countdown timer function.
4. Giving the user feedback on if the answer was correct versus incorrect.
5. Creating the final page with the initials and submit button.
6. Populating all the high scores within local storage.
7. Final styling of the page.
